# Endowment Plan - Java Inheritance Project

This is a Java-based application built to automate the management of endowment plans for the Mother Teresa Endowment. The system calculates the amount to be paid based on the type of endowment â€” either **educational** or **health** â€” using **inheritance** and **polymorphism** in object-oriented programming.

## Features

- Captures endowment holder details (ID, name, registration date, etc.)
- Supports:
  - **Educational Endowment** (School, Undergraduate, Postgraduate)
  - **Health Endowment** (based on holder's age)
- Calculates endowment amount dynamically
- Demonstrates inheritance through an abstract class `Endowment` and two subclasses
- Case-insensitive input handling for endowment types

## Technologies Used

- Java
- OOP Concepts: Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism
- Console-based user input/output
